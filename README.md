# Current Progress:
  The Oculus BootLoader seems to be locked in the Blue, Attempting to Sideload and or Flash Unauthorized firmware to the Oculus Bootloader while in EIO mode    results in the quest failing to boot and usually a soft brick, hard bricks are known to happen when tampering with the bootloader using incorrectly configured firmware files. Currently, Unlocking the quest's bootloader is currently not possible using traditonal methods. Python should be used to interact with Linux outside of the quest while Java/Kotlin should be used for apps on the quest, C# will also be used.
